# You want to boil an egg for 9 mins and you have a 4min and 7min hour glass.
# Sol: Done in 13 minutes by starting to boil at the 4th minute.
# 0m: flip both timers
# 4m: start boiling, you have a 3m and 4m timer. Continue running the 3m timer
# 7m: You have a 7 m and a 1-3 m timer.Cont running the 1 min timer
# 8m: You have a 6-1m and a 4m timer, run the 1 m timer.
# 9m: Run the 4m timer to get 13 mins, giving 9m on the egg.
# This is probably the optimal sol in terms of time, but not necessarily in terms of actions done.
