Notes on satellite images:

- images can be visible, IR + more.
- IR measures temperature (clouds up higher are colder)
- IR can be used to measure reflectivity of white masses (clouds and snow)
- Clouds move, (in comparison to snow, for example), so sequences can be considered
- What is the cloud detection going to be used for
- What resolution images are we considering
- What is the opaqueness of clouds that we are interested in.
- JPEG compression is sometimes used for cloud detection
