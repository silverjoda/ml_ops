Derivation of decision rule:

V_co: Value of compensation (settlement)
P_co: Probability of compensation (given past data)
Cp: Current price
thresh: Threshold above which we are willing to consider doing the transaction

I understand the problem the following way:
- We have 0MW of energy and we are considering of buying just 1MW at price of Cp or doing nothing.
- If we do nothing, we have a net expected gain of 0.
- If we decide to buy, then if there is settlement (positive consumption) then we receive a gain of (V_co - Cp)
- If we decide to buy and there is not settlement, then we are forced to sell at 0Eur, meaning a loss equal to Cp.

We should buy iff:

(V_co - Cp) * P_co > Cp * (1 - P_co) + th

=>
(V_co - Cp) * P_co - Cp * (1 - P_co) - th > 0

=>
V_co * P_co - Cp * P_co - Cp + Cp * P_co - th > 0 (cancel the Cp * P_co)

=>

Decision rule: V_co * P_co - Cp - th > 0
We should buy if the decision rule above holds. Now We only have to find P_co given historical data.

How to find P_co given historical data:
Process the data to get a positive/negative label for each hour for the consumption.
Fit a regression model or Gaussian process for P(set_t=True | set_(t-1),..set_(t-h)) where set is the whether
the settlement was made and h is a horizon that is relevant for the current data point.
