1) You have 480 painted cubes:

2 full sides = 2 * 100
+
2 sides minus the edges = 2 * (100 - 2 * 10)
+ top + bottom minues 4 edges each = 2 * (100 - 4 * 10 )

200 + 160 + 120 = 480

2) Number of hairs is discrete. If there are more dogs than maximum number of hairs, then using the pigeonhole
principle there will be more than one dog with the same number of hairs. If we assume on dog per person, then we have a bit less than 10 billion dogs.
There are probably less than that many hairs on a dog. If there are less dogs than maximum amount of hairs on a dog, then it's still very
likely that there is at least 2 dogs with the same amount of hairs because the amount of hairs on a dog comes from a relatively peaked distribution (with respect to
the support).

3) Depends heavily on the rationality of each agent (person). If the depth of thinking is roughly 1, then we should choose
number 50 - 0.5 * 50 . If the depth of thinking of each agent is infinite then the average converges to zero.

4) We assume that the distribution of the speed of each car is symmetric (variance doesn't matter if they are all the same).
Then starting from the first car (the most forward car), the size of the cluster will depend on the expected length of cars
that have a *faster* speed than the first. This length will follow a binomial distribution, and will form a cluster.
The first car that has a slower speed than the cluster will form another cluster. These clusters will act like individual cars and also follow a binomial
distribution. The expected size of each cluster is equal to the expected to the mean length.

5)Profit = selling price of gold - buying price of silver - buying price of device

6) FN casino:  If I understood correctly, we should play the first game since the expected payoff is more than zero: prob of winning = 0.5 and payoff is 2.1.
We should bet the maximal amount.
We shouldn't play the second game.

7) This game involves selection without replacement. The first pick doesn't matter,
 but should pick from the second deck because at the second pick there is a larger chance of getting a black than from the first deck (25/51) vs (12/25)

8)
- Total bitcoin worth at current price > 10^12 $
- ISS = 15 * 10 ^ 9
- 1 m BTC = 20 * 10^ 9

Price of our BTC covers the new ISS dream, but the question is if you can liquidate all that BTC (restrictions etc).
Another question is whether you will affect the price by performing the liquidation (probably not that much since its a small percentage of total worth)

9) 3 constraints:  A1 * A2 * A3 = 36,  A1 + A2  + A3 = Num of windows (must a number which is nxm, can't be prime), oldest son is Vojta means that
there exists an oldest son, meaning that the largest number should be unique.
I brute forced all factors of 36 which satisfy constraints and I get that  12, 3, 1 and 9, 4, 1 both satisfy (program is in attachment)

10) This is a sequential game. Payoff = 2^N
Probability of getting sequence of length N is 0.5 ^ N
Expected payoff Ep = (0.5) ^ N * (2 ^ N).
I would play the game if I can pay less than the expected payoff Ep.
